            Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program
             to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves 
             tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource 
             consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly 
             referred to as coding). The source code of a program is written in one or more languages 
             that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by 
             the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions 
             that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) 
             on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus often requires 
             expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, 
             specialized algorithms, and formal logic.
